# Smart Config by Webserver

Make your ESP connect to any Wifi network without using traditional Smart Config.

## How it works

The ESP will use Wifi mode as AP (Access point) and create a webserver on port 80. The user will connect to the ESP's Wifi network and open a browser.

Then the browser will be redirected to the ESP's webserver. The user will enter the Wifi credentials and the ESP will connect to the Wifi network.
